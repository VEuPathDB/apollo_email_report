On behalf of the VEuPathDB.org team we would like to thank you for using Apollo to improve gene annotation.
You should receive a separate email giving more details about any errors.
A list, of unfinished genes, is attached to this Email. This report will only take protein-coding genes into consideration.
Please remember you must mark a gene status as Finished in the Apollo information editor, before it will be integrated in VEuPathDB.org.

If you need more help do not hesitate to contact us: help@veupathdb.org.

You can find more information on annotating genes in Apollo in our apollo FAQ pages https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/faq.html#apollo
